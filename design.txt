'The dead ends that are in the upper part of the maze are not detected but the

'Level improving from ucs -d to f -d
'The algorithm with action compression (f) can solve this level much faster, 
'since there are only 4 box moves (compressed actions) available. Without
'action compression (ucs) there are a high amount of states to consider for 
'the algorithm which explains the much higher runtime.

'Level improving from f -d to fa -d
'The number of different possible box moves is very high, which is why the
'action compression algorithm (f) alone performs poorly on this level.
'Since the manhattan distance is a perfect heuristic for this specific
'level, the A* algorithm (fa) can reduce the number of states considerably
'and achieves a much better performance.

'Optional: level for the Sokoban contest
'The reason why we think that this level is solved quickly by our heuristic because it starts putting boxes nearer 
'to the goal more quickly than boxes farther from the goal.
'So as boxes nearer to the goals are put to the goal, it opens space for for movement of the boxes that can be seen
'In the vertical line to find faster positions to the goal, so the algorithm forces to discover these states and 
'does not go around looking for more complicated paths to the goal and comsume more time.
'The non linarity in our heuristic is enabling a much lower cost of nearby boxes and hence it is a good approach.
'In addition we do not directly use the manhattan distance to estimate the distance we use the actual shortest 
'distance from the box to goal that is reachable so it is better in estimating the true cost.
